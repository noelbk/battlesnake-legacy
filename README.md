## Preparing for Battle
Everything you need to know before attending BattleSnake.

### Come Prepared

Your team __will be writing code__, come prepared to do so. You should also have the following ready
* Laptop with the following setup:
  * Git
  * Programming language of choice (Node, Python, Java, etc)
  * A text editor (Sublime Text, Vim, etc)
* A [GitHub](http://github.com) account
* A free [Heroku](http://heroku.com) account

### Learning Heroku

For novice and intermediate programmers, we __strongly__ recommend familiarizing yourself with [Heroku](http://heroku.com) before hand. Deploying with [Heroku](http://heroku.com) will maximize time spent developing your AI (and not messing around with servers). All provided code samples and example AIs will be ready-to-deploy to Heroku.

## Tournament Details

Tournament starts at 6:00.	
All snake urls must be submitted by this time.	
Tournament games will be played on a 15x15 board.	
There will be 3 rounds total.	
Rounds will consist of Best of 3 games between up to 6 snakes.	
Each game awards points as follows:	
* 1st:	5 pts
* 2nd:	3 pts
* 3rd:	2 pts
* 4th:	1 pt
* 5-6th:	0 pts
<br>
If two snakes die on the same turn, tiebreakers work as follows:	
<br>
* 1) Longest snake	
* 2) Most kills	
* 3) Both snakes receive the lesser # of pts	
<br>
The x snakes with the highest # of points advance to the next round.	
If two or more snakes tie for round advancement, a tiebreaker game will be held between the tied snakes.	
The finals work the same as the previous rounds, except there will be only 4 players, and the round is a best of 5 games.	

## Game Rules

This is how things work.

### Objective

BattleSnake is an adaptation of the classic video game "Snake" where you control a snake as it move around the play field.  Each round pits up to X snakes against eachother, and the goal is to be the last snake left alive at the end of the round.

### How do you die?

* Running into another snake.
* Running into your own body.
* Running into the walls of the play field.
* Head to head collisions result in the death of the shorter snake (or both if tied).
* Your snake starves.

### Starvation

* It's a snake eat snake world out there, and you must eat regularly to survive.
* Your snake starts out with 100 life, and counts down by 1 each turn.
* When your life total reaches 0, your snake dies of starvation.

### How to avoid starvation?

* To avoid being sacrificed, you must ensure that your snake is well fed.
* Food will spawn randomly around the board.
* Each piece of food eaten will increase the length of your snake by 1, and reset your life to 100.
* Killing another snake by cutting them off with your body will increase the length of your own snake and reset your life to 100.
* Kills increase your length by half of the victims length, rounded down.

### Sportsmanship

* Fuck sportsmanship.

## Snake API Documentation

For more information visit [battlesnake.io](http://www.battlesnake.io).

### General Client Rules

* Game clients must exist at a valid HTTP URL capable of responding to the requests specified below.
* Clients must respond to all requests within 2 seconds or face disqualification.
* All requests must return a 200 status code and a valid response body or face disqualification.

### POST /start

Signals the start of a BattleSnake game. All clients must respond with a 200 status code and valid response object or risk being disqualified.

Since game IDs may be re-used, this endpoint may be called multiple times with the same game ID. Clients use this call to reset any saved game state for the given game ID.

##### Request

* **game_id** - ID of the game about to start
* **width** - The width of the game board (the x axis)
* **height** - The height of the game board (the y axis)

```javascript
{
  "game_id": "hairy-cheese",
  "width": 20,
  "height": 20
}
```

##### Response

* **name** - friendly name of this snake
* **color** - display color for this snake (must be CSS compatible)
* **head_url** _(optional)_ - full URL for a 100x100 snake head image
* **taunt** _(optional)_ - string message for other snakes

```js
{
  "name": "Team Gregio",
  "color": "#ff0000",
  "head_url": "http://img.server.com/snake_head.png",
  "taunt": "Let's rock!"
}
```

### POST /move

Failing to respond appropriately
if invalid response, snake moves forward

##### Request

* **game_id** - ID of the game being played
* **turn** - turn number being played
* **board** - current board state (see [Board State Objects](#board-state-objects))
* **snakes** - array of snakes in play (see [Snake Objects](#snake-objects))
* **food** - array of food coordinates (see [Food Arrays](#food-arrays))

```javascript
{
  "game_id": "hairy-cheese",
  "turn": 1,
  "board": [
    [<BoardTile>, <BoardTile>, ...],
    [<BoardTile>, <BoardTile>, ...],
    ...
  ],
  "snakes":[<Snake>, <Snake>, ...],
  "food": [[1, 4], [3, 0], [5, 2]]
}
```

##### Response

* **move** - this snakes' next move, one of: ["up", "down", "left", "right"]
* **taunt** _(optional)_ - string message to other snakes

```javascript
{
  "move": "up",
  "taunt": "go snake yourself"
}
```

### POST /end

Indicates that a specific game has ended. No more move requests will be made. No response required.

##### Request

* **game_id** - id of game being ended

```javascript
{
  "game_id": "hairy-cheese"
}
```

##### Response

_Responses to this endpoint will be ignored._

### Board State Objects

Describes the state of the board for a specific game. Board State Objects are comprised of a 2-Dimensional array of Board Tiles. This array is indexed to match board coordinates, such that the board tile for coordinates (1, 5) are accessible at _board[1][5]_. Board coordinates are 0-based with [0][0] representing the top left corner.

##### Example Board State

```javascript
[
  [<BoardTile>, <BoardTile>, ...],
  [<BoardTile>, <BoardTile>, ...],
  ...
]
```

##### Board Tiles

* **state** - one of ["head", "body", "food", "empty"]
  * _head_ - occupied by snake head (see snake attribute)
  * _body_ - occupied by snake body (see snake attribute)
  * _food_ - contains an uneaten piece of food
  * _empty_ - an empty tile
* **snake** _(optional)_ - name of occupying snake (if applicable)

```javascript
{
  "state": "head",
  "snake": "Noodlez"
}
```

### Snake Objects

Describes the state of a single snake in a particular game.

##### Attributes

* **name** - friendly name of this snake (must be unique)
* **state** - snake state, one of ["alive", "dead"]
* **coords** - ordered array of coordinates indicating location of this snake on the board (from head to tail)
* **score** - current score
* **color** - display color for this snake
* **head_url** - full URL to 20x20 snake head image
* **taunt** - latest string message to other snakes

```javascript
{
  "name": "Noodlez",
  "state": "alive",
  "coords": [[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2]],
  "score": 4,
  "color": "#ff0000",
  "head_url": "http://img.server.com/snake_head.png",
  "taunt": "I'm one slippery noodle"
}
```

### Food Arrays

An array of coordinate tuples representing food locations.

##### Example

```javascript
[
  [1, 4], [3, 0], [5, 2]
]
```

## Questions?

We will go over these clarifications partway through the day.  If you have any other questions, just ask anyone in sendwithus gear!

FYI!  If you start a game with more than one snake sharing the same name, it will glitch and crash the game.  We will probably be pushing a fix out for this in a bit, but for now, make sure your snakes all have unique names (we recommend using your team name).

Q: How do I determine the life of my snake!?

A: Once a snake has eaten food or killed another snake, they will return a 'last_eaten' field that gives the last turn they have grown.  Once the current turn is 100 greater than the turn they have last eaten, their life will be 0 and the snake will die.  If a snake has not yet eaten, this field will not exist on that snake, and should be treated as 0.

Q: Where does my snake start?

A: You will be given the starting coordinates of your snake when the first move is requested.  You must identify your own snake by its name.  All snakes start with a length of 3, but begin on a single coordinate.  The first two turns will grow off of this space, and then the snake will begin to move.
